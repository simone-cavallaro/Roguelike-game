    #     In our case, having an entity in entities twice doesn’t make sense.
    # - event_handler is the same event_handler that we used in main.py. It will handle our events.
    # - player is the player Entity. We have a separate reference to it outside of entities for ease of access. 
    #     We’ll need to access player a lot more than a random entity in entities.
